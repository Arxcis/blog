# Star Wars and two ways two ways to show love

I never liked Star Wars. It has grown on me. Everything changed when I realized that Star Wars is a love story. I discovered that Star Wars has a deeper story to it, not realized in my initial interpretetation it. 

The overarching struggle in Star Wars is always the struggle between The Dark Side and the Jedi. Notice there are no Non-Dark Side in Star Wars. But it is useful to think of The Jedi as the opposite of the Dark Side. The way of The Dark Side vs The Way of the Force.

What I realized is that people on The Dark Side and the people in following The Way of the Force, both want the same thing, namely they want to protect and care for what they love. What separates them is their methods. 

The Jedi-order cares for their loved ones by embracing freedom. They want to help each other to become free. The dark side on the other hand, embraces control. Control, structure, constraints is what they apply to keep what they love. They want to keep everything, control it, never letting it go.

In our everyday relationships, we can experience both The Way of the Force and The Dark Side mentality, depending on the situation and mood we are in. On one side we want to give our peers the tools to go out in the world and be free. To love them, we have to be able to let them go.  On the other side, we want to keep what we love close to us. Clinging on to it. Keeping it in our control. This is the way of the Dark Side. Both sides are about showing love.
