# Privacy - Am I being paranoid or informed?

_A letter to friends, family and colleagues who are worried about my obsession with privacy._

_Published 2020-10-04 by Jonas Johan Solsvik._

Dear people who know me personally and professionally. You may have noticed that I am above average interested in privacy issues related to our everyday computer software. Some may even classify me as being paranoid. Some wonder if I know something they don't since I am involved in the software industry. This letter is an attempt to address your concerns, and give you more insight into what goes on inside my mind.

## Why am I obsessing about privacy?

A common reason to be interested in privacy is fear. Fear of the government, fear of coorporations, fear of people in close relations. In general fear of exposing our darkest secrets to someone who are in a position to use whatever knownledge they aquire about us against us when we are vurnerable. I have, although, sympathy for people who are motivated by fear to use privacy focused apps - this is personally not what drives my interest.

Working with developing software every day, I see that frequently it is not greed, or the thirst for power, that drives developers to implement software which could potentially be used to spy on you. Most of the time it comes down to: What is easy and what is hard? Software engineers are trained to, when faced with a problem, always picking the easiest solution, which solves the specific problem at hand.

It is easy to create software that destroys your privacy. I just requires the developers to do pretty much nothing about it. This is because software by nature gives everyone working the software full visibility of everything that happens. Often software developers encourage this visibility even more, to make it easier to figure out what to do if something goes wrong with an app.

My conclusion is that making software that respects your privacy is hard. It requires careful thought and consideration, which makes it an interesting problem to solve, which in turn makes it worth obessing about ;)

## Why does society need privacy focused software?

For some, obsessing about something to satisfy a personal desire, is not a good enough reason to justify an obsession. Some may need an obsession to also serve a greater purpose. It needs to serve society as a whole.

## The cost of powerful technology in the hands of individuals

Consider the norwegian telecom industry, the duopoly Telenor and Telia in particular. All communication and metadata - the whereabouts and whatabouts of norwegian citizens sim-cards - are routed through these two networks. As a society we are putting a great amount of trust into the individuals running these companies. 

In addition government regulations requires everything that happens in these networks to be logged minimum 6 months, up to 24 months. (ref: Datalagringsdirektivet). This further increases the trust we are giving to Telenor and Telia.

This inherent feature of a nationwide communication platform yields the few individuals in control a great amount of power, responsibility, knownledge about what is going on with the whereabouts and whatabouts of the entire norwegian population. I would argue that this also is an immense ethical burden for a society to put on the respective individuals enforcing this practice.

Making sure that these individuals does the right thing requires further government regulations. Laws needs to be discussed and passed. It also requires a different set of individuals to make sure the laws are enforced, and that the breaker of the laws are being prosecuted. All this activity around making sure nothing goes wrong induces a great cost to society. 

But is it a necessary expenditure? Is it the price we pay for powerful technology?

## How may trustless software help?

With trustless communication software - for instance (ref: Signal) - there are no single individual which has the full picture of what is going on. In fact, by design, such software only allows you to see your own whereabouts and whatabouts. No individuals need to be trusted to do the right thing, for keeping the privacy of individuals using the software intact. 

No person can be evil, have a bad day, make a mistake, be corrupt. No laws has to passed to ensure the now non-existing people are kept in line. No inspectors are required to make sure the non-existing laws are being followed. No politicians are required to discuss the laws we don't need. In my eyes it just saves a lot of work, and the focus of the people mentioned above could be put elsewhere.

Having trustless software is just having a software with a lot fewer things(people) that could go wrong, fewer moving parts(people) that could break, fewer things(people) to worry about. Trustless software does what they are designed for, and nothing more. You could call it "boring software", in a good way.

Ironically trustless software, is the software you can trust the most, because there are nobody you have to trust.

## The scalability problem of trust

My example above was just about communication, but software is making it's way into every part of society. "Smart cars", "smart banks", "smart lights", "smart medicine", "smart toasters", "smart whatever". Every day there are new people launching an app, with a new set of individuals society has to trust to manage your private information. 

In software we would call this a scalability problem. "The scalability problem of trust." Every time a new app is released the cost to society, of making sure that people involved in developing the app are following laws, goes up by an equal amount. How do we cope with this?

The short answer is that we don't. The current tactic is to try to keep an eye on certain critical areas like communication mentioned above. But most new software goes below the radar, and we just cross our fingers that the people working there will do the right thing. Because it is just too goddam expensive for society to keep track of it all. 

## Conclusion

So lets get back to the original question of this letter: 

>Am I being paranoid or informed

...or maybe somewhere in between?

Let me know what you think. I would love to continue the discussion and extend/improve this letter, in a privacy-oriented communication software of your choice. As long as it is one of these:

- Signal - https://signal.org/en/
- Protonmail - https://protonmail.com/

Thank you, and have a great day :)
