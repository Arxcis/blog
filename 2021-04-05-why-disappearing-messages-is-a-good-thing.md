# Why disappearing messages is a good thing

I am writing this post, because I have be struggling to explain this topic lately. Multiple of my friends have asked me: "Why do you want disappearing messages, when communicating over the Signal protocol?". The best reason I can give them is: "Because my gut-feeling tells me to.". This post tries to make the explanation less of a gut-feeling, and more a concrete line of reasoning. Here we go.


## Reason 1: Storage space

No matter where you store your conversations, they will take up storage space. If it is on your local drive, or in your cloud, some storage will have to be allocated. Like any storage, real or virtual, it has an inherit cost associated with it. Someone has to pay for the storage. Maybe you don't have to pay for it directly, but the cost is there, one way or the other. 

As of late images, videos, gifs, and other rich media, has increased in volume, in sync with our devices growing more powerful and feature-rich. These extra features require disproportionate amounts of extra storage space - and corresponding cost.

Storage comparison of some popular media-types:
- This sentence requires 45 bytes of storage.
- The images I have received on Signal lately has an average requirement of about 200 000 bytes.
- A 20 second, 15FPS GIF I made, is about 20 million bytes (20MB).

If a conversation consist only of sentences, the storage requirements are negligble. Most conversations in modern chat-clients, like Signal, is a festival of emojis, gifs, videos, pictures, memes, all piling up on your disk, or your cloud, for what purpose?


## Reason 2: YAGNI - You ain't gonna need it

Why do you need to store it there - forever? The shelf-life of most messages being sent and received in a conversation, is very short. They are only relevant in the heat of the moment. In two weeks, you will be talking about the other stuff, and whatever you said more than a couple of hours ago, is by far outdated.

Of course there will be golden messages, in between. Things that need to be remembered. Pictures that is to pretty to discard. There should be a mechanism to easily keep these jewels from disappearing. I would argue that letting most messages disappear, will make the jewels stand out even more, making sure they are not lost in the big stack of unimportant jibberish. Making sure they are transferred to a safe place where they can shine on their own.


## Reason 3: A relationship is not a list of messages

The only thing that is persistent, is the relationship the conversation is building up. The messages in the conversation is not the relationship. They are just short snippets of signals transferred between two brains. The real relationship persists inside the participants mind, even though the messages that built the relationship disappears, the relationship will persist.


## Reason 4: Freedom from regret and self-judgement

There are a lot of things we say and do, which when we look back on them, seem stupid. This "looking back on stupid things" will many times fill us with regret. Is it necessary? When having a conversation in the analog way, using soundwaves through air-only, we do not have this problem. In cyberspace everything we will ever do, has the potential to recorded. We will be potentially be responsible for every action we take. This is not freedom. This limits us. This gives us fear of mistakes. Fear of mistakes is the greatest limit to innovation, growth, experimentation. 

The internet should have a selective memory, like our brains do. We think of our brains incapbility of not remembering everything that happens as a fault, but it is not. It is the greatest feature of the brain. It enables us to not be bogged down my the past, and always look towards the future.

## Reson 5: It feels like Snapchat

I remember when I first installed Snapchat. What a refreshing way of communicating. Fire of an image, without thinking about it. If you want your conversations to feel like Snapchat, then disappearing messages is the way to go.
